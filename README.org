* Openssl examples
Sample C++ code with encryption and decryption using the Openssl libraries. A couple of short snippets to generate hashes (md5 and sha256) are also included.

** API
*** encrypt_and_b64
Encrypts the supplied C++ string and returns (via output arguments) a base64 encoded and encrypted message, a base64 encoded and encrypted key and a base64 encoded Initialization Vector (IV).
*** db64_and_decrypt
Decrypts the supplied base64 encoded and encrypted message, base64 encoded and encrypted key and base64 encoded key and returns (via an output argument) the decrypted string.
*** get_md5
Returns (via output argument) a hex-version of the md5 hash generated for the input string.
*** get_md5
Returns (via output argument) a hex-version of the sha256 hash generated for the input string.
